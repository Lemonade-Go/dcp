Original Question:
> Given two strings A and B, return whether or not A can be shifted some number of times to get B.

Quick Solution:
Duplicate string A and check if A in B

Extra Credit:
Check how many times rotating left or right to get a match

Initially, i only shifted to the right, then thought it would be cool to add both left and right, and pick the optimal shift.

Feedback welcome!
